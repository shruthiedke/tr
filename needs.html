    Positive effects of tourism
Social

Amenities
 built for tourists such as health centres or 
infrastructure
 such as roads, water and 
sewerage systems
 can also benefit locals leading to a higher 
standard of living
.
For those that can afford to travel, visiting other countries provides an opportunity for tourists to meet new people and discover new places. This is often only an option for tourists from high-income countries.
Economic
The tourism industry is worth trillions of pounds worldwide providing jobs and income to millions of people.<br></br>
It is estimated that tourism accounts for about 10% of the world’s gross domestic product (
GDP
).
Over 100 million people are employed directly in the travel and tourism 
sector
with hundreds of millions more employed in industries which support this sector. This might include baggage handlers at airports or farms who provide food to restaurants.
This money provides income which can be used to develop and invest in schools, hospitals, infrastructure and new technology.
This is especially important for low-income countries (
LICs
) such as Jamaica where tourism accounts for 35% of their income.
Environmental
Tourism is often associated with having a negative environmental impact although 
sustainable
 tourism can actually help to protect 
fragile
 environments.<br></br>
The money earned from tourism, can be invested in conservation.
Tourism can provide different types of jobs meaning people aren’t forced to damage the environment in order to make a living.
Tourists can be educated on the importance of environmental protection.
